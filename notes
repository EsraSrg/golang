Go Syntax

A Go file consists of the following parts:

    Package declaration
    Import packages
    Functions
    Statements and expressions

    Declaring (Creating) Variables:

    var variablename type = value
     variablename := value 



The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read-only.
const CONSTNAME type = value

Output Functions
If we want to print the arguments in new lines, we need to use \n.



The Printf() function first formats its argument based on the given formatting verb and then prints them.

Here we will use two formatting verbs:

    %v is used to print the value of the arguments
    %T is used to print the type of the arguments

    DECLARE AN ARRAY
    

array_name := [length]datatype{values} // here length is defined

or

array_name := [...]datatype{values} // here length is inferred 

Array Initialization

If an array or one of its elements has not been initialized in the code, it is assigned the default value of its type.

Tip: The default value for int is 0, and the default value for string is "".

The len() function is used to find the length of an array.

SLÄ°CES
unlike arrays, the length of a slice can grow and shrink as you see fit.
In Go, there are several ways to create a slice:

    Using the []datatype{values} format
    Create a slice from an array
    Using the make() function
