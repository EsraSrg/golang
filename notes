Go Syntax

A Go file consists of the following parts:

    Package declaration
    Import packages
    Functions
    Statements and expressions

    Declaring (Creating) Variables:

    var variablename type = value
     variablename := value 



The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read-only.
const CONSTNAME type = value
